# AIKO
aiko voice assistant. a rebuild of ningyo assistant, because I lost the files as of 2024. I'm noob so I take notes a lot. AIKO, is my OC in my story.

# Files
source codes have descriptive nomenclature in front of their name. listener, transcriber, commands, tts, and module. so we can replace the parts in case of deprecation. we also only need to change the import names (hopefully).

# Runtime Logs
- `AIKO:` means it needs to be read by the user
- `[process]` is just process debugging to check if a certain codeblocks is run. also to differentiate my process with 3rd party library process
- `[warning]` is a warning
